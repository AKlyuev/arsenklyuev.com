Are you a thinker or a builder?

Throughout my career as a software engineer, I've noticed that some people seem to have a knack for building things. Of course, as software engineers, we are always building things, but that is because it's our job. However, there is a subset of engineers who build things outside of work: the types that have side projects, that seem to stay up to date with latest technologies, that have the energy or desire to code outside of work.

While I don't want to silo people into two boxes and consider this more of a spectrum, I came to the realization that I am certainly not a builder. I am not one of those people that builds new things outside of their job, produces content, or tinkers with existing material. From a software engineer perspective, I have never completed/deployed a side project.

I do, however, love learning. Consuming and contextualizing new information is one of the few labor-related things that I can unambiguously say I enjoy. I've always been quick at picking up new subjects, and one of the main compliments I've received in my career came from one of my managers: “We tell a lot of people they're good at onboarding onto new teams and technologies, but you're _actually_ very good at it.” I like the process of putting pieces together of a new topic until I really begin to understand it. My hobbies reflect this: I'm big on reading, puzzles, and games.

However, it seems that many of the best software engineers are the ones who are builders. At the very least, the people who create companies seem to be builders. A lot of such people may have started some form of this at a young age, whether it was helping their parents on a farm or making Minecraft mods. Perhaps this is obvious - to start a company, you need to make something. And entrepreneurship is often described as a game of “at bats,” where the more swings you take, the more likely you are to succeed.

So we arrive at a problem: How do us non-builders who are SWEs reconcile the fact that our interests and talents are not the perfect fit for our career? I suspect a lot of SWEs may be in a similar situation - good learners who do well in school, allowing them to choose from a variety of careers. Technically-inclined ones with no strong passions will likely choose to become software engineers, a relatively high-paying career with good WLB. While the strong analytical skills of learners are certainly beneficial in some areas of software engineers, it seems the builders come out on top.

There seem to be a few options.

1. Go in a different direction with your career that is more thinking, less building - e.g. venture capital, finance
2. Get to a position within your engineering organization that is more thinking than building - e.g. a management role instead of being an individual contributor.
3. Learn to build.

All 3 options have their merits, and different options will be best for different people.

Before we move on, however, we should acknowledge a key fact: the best builders are also very capable thinkers. You can not build something good without knowing a lot about the area in which you are building, and how to build. Many engineers who work on side projects closely follow the latest relevant tech. The best builders think and build, meaning either they really enjoy both, or one of the two really feels like work to them and they do it anyways. And sure, a few of the best builders are geniuses, but I know plenty of good builders who are not.

With this acknowledged, I have chosen option 3: learn to build. There is some dissonance between my reality and desire: I'm more of a thinker than a builder, but I WANT to become a builder. Perhaps that is why I enjoy doing coding/software tutorials so much - it feels like I'm building something, but really I'm just learning something.

I want to be a builder because I think in 50 years, I will be more proud of something I have built than anything I would output as a result of only functioning in “thinking” roles. This is a personal choice - people can absolutely do highly impactful things without building anything. Any sort of role that is primarily focused on decision-making and strategy is likely best suited for thinkers. This includes heads of government, many c-suite execs, and more.

It's also clear to me that the more and more experienced you get, the more you must shift towards thinking instead of building. Good builders can multiply their impact by guiding other builders instead of building themselves, which is an unfortunate truth many software engineers learn as they move upwards in their careers. Legendary programmer John Carmack described as much:

> "I had somewhat resigned myself to the fact that I might be missing out on the 'final abstraction', where you realize that managing people is more powerful than any personal tool."

However, I believe people in these roles are still functioning as builders, even if they're not the ones always writing the code themselves. It's figuring out what to build and how to build it that matter, which happens at varying levels of abstraction.

Furthermore, I don't actually know if I am inherently a learner or if I enjoy it because it is what I grew up doing and it therefore comes easily to me. This is an argument of nature vs. nurture. I will likely only find out the answer if I try out building, a lot, for a while. Maybe I'll realize I was only interested in building because it seems sexy, and learning and thinking is what truly makes me happy. Or maybe I'll fall in love with building stuff and make something cool one day. Either way it's a win.

So there you have it: I made this website because I wanted to build something. Because I want to learn how to build things of my own volition, and unfortunately for me, you can't learn that by reading a book. I also wanted a place to write down my thoughts and practice my writing, but I would have just used Squarespace if that's the only thing I cared about ;)

Thanks for reading,
