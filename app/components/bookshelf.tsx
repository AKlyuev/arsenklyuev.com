        "The first book that helped me truly get a sense of what high frequency traders actually do. An excellent exposÃ© of Wall Street corruption. It is both a great story and interesting explanation of the arbitrage HFTs do by using low-latency infrastructure and techniques that let them execute trades faster than everyone else. Not to mention the big banks that enable them. I didn't realize it was possible to get guaranteed returns in the stock market, but it is via legal arbitrage techniques like the ones HFTs implement. No wonder they make so much money.",
