I don't want to spoil what happens in this book, but it is an unbelievable, _true_ story of betrayal. The book is very hard to put down, and the author deserves a lot of praise. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I plan on it. 

### Do I Recommend This Book: Yes

This is not only a fascinating story - itâ€™s also an important part of American history. I highly recommend reading it.
