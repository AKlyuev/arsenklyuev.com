I won't say what exactly happens in this book because I don't want to spoil anything, but this is an unbelievable true story of betrayal on a level I've hardly heard of. Very hard to put down. The author deserves much, much praise.

### Should You Read This: Yes
This is an incredibly interesting story and an important part of American history. I highly recommend reading this book.
